# DOT.DOT.DOT

## manage your dotfiles

By default, this comes with ssh and zsh examples, and my tmux configuration, which includes tmux-powerline

## WARNING: might destroy all your dotfiles. Back them up yourself.

### Installation and execution

    git clone git@github.com:vishvish/dotdotdot.git
    
    cd dotdotdot
    
    git submodule init
    
    git submodule update

You ought to have a look at `etc/config.yml` which is where you decide what gets linked and what doesn't.

The program performs four tasks:

1. backs up all the files named in `config.yml`, whether they're symlinks or not as a gzipped tar file into its `backups` directory.

2. removes all the files specified in the config.

3. symlinks all the active files/directories specified in the config.

4. cleans up the backups directory. Number of backups kept are specified at the top of the config. Default is 5.

#### To run

    cd dotdotdot

    ruby dotdotdot.rb
